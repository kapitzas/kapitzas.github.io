      <description>I am a PhD Candidate at the Quantitative &amp;amp; Applied Ecology Group, a diverse and dynamic ecological modelling group at the University of Melbourne. Despite being enrolled in Australia, I have permanently returned to Berlin and successfully continued my work remotely. Since my return, I have also been affiliated with the Macroecology Lab at Potsdam University as research and teaching assistant.
I am an interdisciplinary global change ecologist researching interactions between socio-economic and bio- physical drivers of biodiversity change.</description>
