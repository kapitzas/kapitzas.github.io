To make things easier I made a little R package out of my workflow that does that really quickly and I will briefly discribe here with examples how it works. I\u0026rsquo;ve since also added support for 90m SRTM tiles that are also downloadable via the raster package, please refer to help files fore details.\nDownload the package from GitHub:\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;kapitzas/WorldClimTiles\u0026quot;)  Load the package and download a boundary file for France.
