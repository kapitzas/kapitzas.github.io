Trends in demography, economic growth, regional alliances and consumption behaviours can have profound effects on the environment by driving resource use and production. While these distant socio-economic drivers impact species and ecosystems at global scales, for example by driving greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the most prevalent human impacts on biodiversity manifest through habitat loss and land use change decisions at finer scales. We provide the first integrated ecological-economic analysis pathway capable of supporting both national policy design challenges and global scale assessment of biodiversity risks posed by socio-economic drivers such as population growth, consumption and trade. To achieve this, we provide state-of-the-art integration of economic, land use, and biodiversity modelling, and illustrate its application using two case studies. We evaluate the national-level implications of change in trading conditions under a multi-lateral free trade agreement for the bird biodiversity of Vietnam. We review the implications for land- use and biodiversity under coupled socio-economic (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) and climate (Resource Concentration Pathways) scenarios for Australia. Our study provides a roadmap for setting up high dimensional integrated analyses foe evaluating global priorities for protecting nature and livelihoods in vulnerable areas with the greatest conflicts for economic, social and environmental opportunities.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting the ecological outcomes of global consumption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Kapitza","Pham Van Ha","Tom Kompas","Nick Golding","Natasha C.

To date, no detailed analyses have been produced that assess the relative importance of, or interaction between, these direct and indirect climate change impacts on biodiversity at large scales. Here, we apply a new integrated modelling framework to quantify the relative influence of biophysical and socio-economically mediated impacts on avian species in Vietnam and Australia. We find that socio-economically mediated impacts on suitable ranges are largely outweighed by biophysical impacts, but global shifts of production are likely to result in adverse impacts on habitats worldwide. By translating economic futures and shocks into spatially explicit predictions of biodiversity change, we now have the power to analyse in a consistent way outcomes for nature and people of any change to policy, regulation, trading conditions or consumption trend at any scale from sub-national to global.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change on avian biodiversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am regularly working with the WorldClim data set and in some cases had to download and merge the individual high res (0.5 arcmin) tiles for my work.
